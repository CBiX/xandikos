Some properties need WebDAV server metadata:

supported-live-property-set needs list of properties
supported-report-set needs list of reports
supported-method-set needs list of methods

Some operations need access to current user information:

current-user-principal
current-user-privilege-set
calendar-user-address-set

PUT/DELETE/MKCOL need access to username (for author) and possibly things like user agent
(for better commit message)


class Context(object):

    def get_current_user(self):
	return (name, principal)
