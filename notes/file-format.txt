Collections are represented as Git repositories on disk.

A specific version is represented as a commit id. The 'ctag' for a calendar is taken from the
tree id of the calendar root tree.

The `entity tag`_ for an event is taken from the blob id of the Blob representing that EVENT. These kinds
of entity tags are strong, since blobs are equivalent by octet equality.

The file name of calendar events shall be <uuid>.ics / <uuid>.vcf. This makes it easy to enforce that there
is only a single entry with a specific UID.

All items in a collection *must* be well formed, so that they do not have to be validated when served.
