Dystros is a set of command-line utilities for working with calendars and
addressbooks that are stored as iCalendar and vCard files in a git repository.

Dystros (Δύστρος) takes its name from the name of the February month in the ancient
Macedonian calendar, used in Macedon in the first millennium BC.
