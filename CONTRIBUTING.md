Xandikos uses the [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guide.
You can verify whether you've introduced any style violations by running
"make style".

There is some very minimal developer documentation/vague design docs in notes/.

Please implement new RFCs as much as possible in their own file.
